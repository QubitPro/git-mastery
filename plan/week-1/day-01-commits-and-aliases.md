# Day 01 — Semantic Commits + Aliases

**Time:** 30 min | **Repo:** `Spotify-lyric-tracker`

---

## Semantic Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

| Type | Use | Example |
|------|-----|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(player): add lyrics popup` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(sync): resolve timing drift` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(readme): add install steps` |
| `style` | Formatting only | `style(css): fix alignment` |
| `refactor` | Restructure code | `refactor(api): extract token logic` |
| `perf` | Performance | `perf(render): cache DOM queries` |
| `test` | Tests | `test(parser): add edge cases` |
| `chore` | Config/deps | `chore(deps): update spotify-api` |

---

## Do This Now

### 1. Check your aliases (already set up)

```bash
cd ~/path/to/Spotify-lyric-tracker
git st
git visual
git last
```

> **Learner Tip:** If aliases aren't set up yet, you'll configure them first. Run `git config --global -l | grep alias` to see what you have.

- [ ] All aliases work

### 2. Create practice branch, make 5 semantic commits

```bash
git checkout -b practice/semantic-commits
```

```bash
echo "// cache module" >> cache.js
git add . && git commit -m "feat(cache): add lyrics caching module"

echo "/* dark styles */" >> dark.css
git add . && git commit -m "style(ui): add dark mode base styles"

echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
git add . && git commit -m "chore(config): update gitignore"

echo "// fix null" >> fix.js
git add . && git commit -m "fix(lyrics): handle null lyrics response"

echo "# Install" >> INSTALL.md
git add . && git commit -m "docs(setup): add installation guide"
```

> **Learner Tip:** Notice how each commit does ONE thing with a clear message. The format is `type(scope): what you did`. Think of `scope` as which part of the project you touched.

### 3. Review your work

```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

- [ ] Every commit clearly shows type + scope + what changed
- [ ] No "WIP", "update", or "fix stuff" messages

### 4. Practice `amend` and `undo`

```bash
# Amend: add forgotten file to last commit
echo "# more" >> INSTALL.md
git add . && git amend
git last

# Undo: undo last commit, keep changes
git undo
git st
git commit -m "docs(setup): add installation guide with details"
```

> **Learner Tip:** `git amend` is your "oops, forgot to include that" button. `git undo` is your "let me redo that commit" button. Both only work on your LAST commit — don't try these on older ones.

- [ ] `git amend` works
- [ ] `git undo` works

### 5. Use `staged` before committing

```bash
echo "test" >> test.txt
echo "test2" >> test2.txt
git add test.txt
git staged          # Only test.txt shows
git add test2.txt
git staged          # Both show
git commit -m "test: add test files"
```

> **Learner Tip:** Always check `git staged` before committing. This prevents accidentally committing files you didn't intend to include.

- [ ] I review staged changes before every commit

### 6. Push your branch to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin practice/semantic-commits
```

> **Learner Tip:** Don't forget this step! Your work only exists locally until you push. The `-u` flag links your local branch to the remote so future `git push` works without extra args.

- [ ] Branch is visible on GitHub

---

## Self-Check

- [ ] I know all 8 commit types
- [ ] Made 5 semantic commits
- [ ] Used `amend`, `undo`, `staged` aliases
- [ ] My `git log` looks professional
- [ ] Pushed branch to GitHub

## SWOT Analysis — Semantic Commits & Aliases

### Strengths
- **Readable history** — Anyone can scan `git log` and instantly understand what changed and why
- **Automated changelogs** — Tools like `standard-version` and `semantic-release` can auto-generate changelogs from commit types
- **Faster code review** — Reviewers can prioritize: `fix` commits need careful review, `style` commits are low-risk
- **Aliases save time** — `git st` vs `git status` adds up over hundreds of daily uses

### Weaknesses
- **Learning curve** — Choosing the right type (`fix` vs `refactor`?) takes practice
- **Overhead on small projects** — For personal throwaway scripts, strict conventions feel heavy
- **Team alignment needed** — Everyone must agree on the format, or it becomes inconsistent

### Opportunities
- **CI/CD integration** — Use commit types to trigger different pipelines (e.g., `feat` → deploy, `docs` → rebuild docs site)
- **Career signal** — Clean git history shows professionalism in interviews and open-source contributions
- **Auto-versioning** — `feat` = minor bump, `fix` = patch bump — fully automated releases

### Threats
- **Over-engineering messages** — Spending 5 minutes crafting the perfect commit message for a one-line change
- **False consistency** — Labeling everything `chore` because you're unsure — defeats the purpose
- **Tool lock-in** — Some teams enforce commit linting so strictly that it slows down rapid prototyping

## Command Explanation Reference

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `git checkout -b <branch>` | Creates a new branch and switches to it | Starting any new feature or practice exercise |
| `git add .` | Stages ALL changed/new files in the current directory | When you want to commit everything you changed |
| `git add <file>` | Stages a specific file only | When you want to commit only certain files |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Creates a commit with the given message | After staging files you want to save |
| `git log --oneline -N` | Shows the last N commits, one line each | Quick check of recent history |
| `git commit --amend` (`git amend`) | Adds staged changes to the LAST commit and lets you edit its message | Forgot a file or made a typo in the last commit |
| `git reset HEAD~1` (`git undo`) | Undoes the last commit but keeps the changes as unstaged files | Want to redo your last commit differently |
| `git diff --cached` (`git staged`) | Shows what's currently staged (ready to commit) | Always run before `git commit` to double-check |
| `git push -u origin <branch>` | Pushes branch to GitHub and sets up tracking | First time pushing a new branch |
| `echo "text" >> file` | Appends text to a file (creates it if it doesn't exist) | Quick way to create/modify files for practice |

> **Key Insight:** `git add` + `git commit` is a two-step process by design. Staging (`add`) lets you choose exactly what goes into each commit. This is what makes clean, focused commits possible.
